make a program to calculate the echelon form of a matrix
also make a program which calculates the reduced echelon form of a matrix
make a program which solves the matrix equation Ax = b
make a program that implements LU factorization
make a program that finds the determinant of a matrix using cofactor expansion
make a program that implements Cramer's rule
make a program that reduces to REF using matrix partitioning
make a program that does matrix multiplication
make a program that applies a linear transformation on a vector
....
basically implement all of the cool stuff we did in Linear Algebra
:D
