		<!-- 
	  handle general matrix dimensions while being respectful of assignment, 
	  three things: assuming fixed matrix dimensions, 
	  give options for specifying dimensions, 
	  try to infer dimensions
	  make tables look better in html so that i can understand them better
	  when retrieving matrix info from document, use variables that make sense
	  use comments so i can understand what i was doing, in case i come back later or break things
	  write flexible code
	  modularize code


	  also, when gathering matrix info from document~ 
	  should i fill empty array 
	  or
	  should i make array in function then return it.. 

	  maybe: put script in separate file..? probably risky, but will see if can do.
