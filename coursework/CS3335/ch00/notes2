don't forget -- 


you can use switch statement in c


format scans limit your program to only accepting certain input

you are responsible for managing the space and contents in an array in C

don't forget about the sentinel value(s) in c

don't forget that atoi is the way to convert string values to numrical values [parsing]




preprocessing
compiling
linking

gcc and args to specify how you want files compiled

...but you can always just do make.. 
:p


what is eof --- end of file

	how do we figure out where the end of the file is??? 

	we can use a do whlie loop.. 

	control c -- your operating system makes the program stop. the OS 
		makes the program stop, it kills the process. you don't 
		want your OS to come in and kill the file

	but... we can tell the program where the end of the file is by doing  ---- 

			CONTROL D      !!!  :P
	your program took that signal and knows to finish that process by itself
		need to import limits headerfile to use EOF
		anyway, eof looks at input, waits for another round of input, waiting for 
			CONTROL D
	

	standard io library, get char

	it's a good idea to type input as an int or other signed character... 
		other types may work , but int is safe.. 
		... sometimes types might be automatically promoted to an integer.
		we don't want to spend time on loops or if,else...[tangent]
		

		~~~~~Type Promotion~~~~~~~

		unsigned char is not promoted to an int, 
		however, signed char is.






		we will start talking about bit manipulation

		it is important and it will be on the next assignment
