take a look at scope
you should know about keywords and access modifiers in c

we will talk about chapter 5 structures 
and chapter 6 
together 




in java we have clsases.
in c we have something similar  
	a structure is a collection of items
	a collection of them, give them a name
	structures only have attributes and not behaviors
we like to chain up structures 
how many deskes do we begin with? 
	then we are talking about a linked list of stucutures 
	that each contain data 
we don't know how many of them there are 
but we know how to get to the next one 
dymanic mem allocation 
how do we get the structs to begin with 
well we ask for them from memory 
we allocate the approptiate memory space for them 
memory diagram, think about it 

there is a section called the stack 
there is also a place called the heap 
requesting sections of memory from the heap 
	this is called dynamic memory allocation 
you have the obligation of returning this data back 
l
if you don't, this is called memory leak


c lets you do what you want



JVM has garbage collector for you 
gc prevents memory leak 



when you request stuff from heap
dont forget to return the data 


otherwise



your computer will allow its memory to get eaten up 


mem leak is a common mistake 


even among skilled programmers

this is waht happens with firefox 



if you have a program that runs for a long time 
memory leak might happen and get messed up 


this happesn with firefox and they can't fix the error because it would break 
everything for them, it's deeply embedded in the code 

introducing dynamic memory allocation
