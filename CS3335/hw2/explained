Set bits explained

Part I. x-mask setup
1. make a block of zeros as big as x
	x^x will do this 
2. negate that whole block of zeros
	~
3. leftshift the whole block n times
	this makes all ones and n zeros
4. negate that ~
	make everything zeros and n ones 
5. shift the mask into position with x bits
	lefthift p-n+1 times
6. negate that
	this makes the mask zeros
8. set x bits to zero with and
	zero and zero


Part II. y-mask setup
1. make a block of zeros as big as y
	y^y will do this
2. negate that to get a block of all ones
3. left shift n times 
	this gives you all ones and n zeros
4. negate that
	this gives you all zeros and n ones
5. GRAB bits from y with AND
	leave mask of ones at end
	and with y
	puts y bits at end
6. leftshift extracted bits into postion
	leftshift p-n+1 times



Part III. set xbits
1. xbits are set to zero
2. ybits are shifted into position
3. use or logic to set y bits into x bits
	one or one/zero
	is there a one
