looking at all the t values from low to high.... 

what you want to do next is to go thru the ind var register the lowest and highest
f values 
register lowerst and highest f(t)

groud the floating point values to the integers

high and low output values


.... 


important values

having those two values will give us the following thing

the idea is ... 

lets come up with an array of characters


manipulating an array of chars or a string



we will use this ti store all the LEADING white spaces.....


don't forget about \0 value


build up to * 
don't forget \0 then you don't need loop to print
after printed, make sure you get rid of * so you can reuse it

so keep building up array until get to output value

but still need array of size max - min + 2!! account for \0! 



c allows you to make an array of size which is a variable 


sssssssss*\0
ssssss*\0
ssssssssss*\0
ssss*\0
sssssssss*\0

clear up array when done

sssssssssss\0




two key points

	the idea of having the \0 at the end of every char array
	talking about the use of printf often in the program
