I can compile the cards.c file like so -- 
gcc cards.c

I can send compile the cards.c file into an executable like so -- 
gcc cards.c -o cards

I can compile into an exectuable then execute like so --
gcc cards.c -o cards && ./cards
	.. which executes only if the cards.c file compiles successfully
