gcc cards.c

I can send compile the cards.c file into an executable like so -- 
gcc cards.c -o cards

I can compile into an exectuable then execute like so --
gcc cards.c -o cards && ./cards

don't forget, to turn on line numbers in vi, try the following: 

turn on -- 
:set nu or :set number
turn off -- 
:set nonu or :set nonumber
also can try :set nu!

to change color scheme, do the following: 

make a .vimrc file
add these lines

syntax on
colorscheme desert
:wq

that's it. 
put in home directory. (i guess)

vi is a text editor from the early days of UNIX
vim, or, vi improved, is an improved verison of vi
