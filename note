today i started using hub
it's a technology that makes github easier
	for example, 

i just forked a repo in the command line
	very easily
	using this command

hub fork 

niiiice. :P

i haven't aliased hub="git" yet.. 

so don't forget that you might should
	do this in the future.. 
...if you want to.
