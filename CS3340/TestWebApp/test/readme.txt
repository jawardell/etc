i made this folder so that i can rebuild the lab 6. 

I need to add all of the web forms and classes from lab 6. 

Why do i need to rebuild it? 

The lab requires you to add another asp.net webform. I can't do that because i did not copy the website solution file into this folder.
Therefore, it is not possible for me to add another web form to the web application because I can't open the solution in VS. (maybe it is possible to add
a webform separately, but i don't know how to do that at this time)

What i need to do in order to complete this lab: 

Add the existing code from HW6 folder into the new web solution in this folder. 
Finish the lab by adding the last webform to the solution in VS. 
Complete any additional steps in the lab. 
Copy the files from this folder into the Lab6 folder. 
Delete this folder. 
Complete. :)
